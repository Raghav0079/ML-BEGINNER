## 📚 Algorithms Covered

### Linear Regression
- Predicts continuous values
- Equation: `y = mx + b`
- Includes feature selection, least squares training, R-squared & MSE evaluation

### Classification
#### Logistic Regression
- Binary classification using sigmoid activation
- Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

#### Decision Trees
- Tree-based supervised learning
- Information gain & Gini impurity
- Tree pruning & depth control

### Clustering
#### K-means
- Unsupervised partitioning
- Steps: initialize centroids, assign points, update centroids, repeat

#### Hierarchical Clustering
- Cluster dendrograms
- Agglomerative & divisive approaches
- Multiple distance metrics
